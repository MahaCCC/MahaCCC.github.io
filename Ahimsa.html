<p align = "justify">Ahimsa, less commonly spelled ahinsa, is an ancient Indian principle of nonviolence which applies to all humans.The only virtue Gandhi wants to claim is truth and nonviolence. Literally translated, ahimsa means to be without harm; to be utterly harmless, not only to oneself and others, but to all living beings. But its implications are far wider; it is more than not doing violence, it is more than an attitude, it is a whole way of life.</p> <center><img src = "b2555d832ff227ef641a4d6fa07f67c4.jpg" width = "300" height ="250">
