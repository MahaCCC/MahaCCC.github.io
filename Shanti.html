Shanti means Peace. Peace is often described as the most elusive of the five values. The reason for its elusiveness is that it is always sought in the external phenomena. Our aim is to foster the qualities such as attention, calmness, concentration, discipline, focus, happiness, honesty, inner silence, patience, reflection, self-acceptance, self-confidence, self-control, self-discipline, self-respect, and understanding.
