<h1>Chinmaya Mission follows the Vedic teacher-student tradition (guru-shishya parampara) and makes available the ageless wisdom of Advaita Vedanta, the knowledge of universal oneness, providing the tools to realize the wisdom in one’s life.</h1>
<h1>Chinmaya Mission's emblem comprises the lamp of knowledge with the hamsa bird of wisdom at its crown, both denoting the Mission's spiritual and social services to the world. The purpose of the Mission's Vedantic teachings is to help seekers learn ethical values and cultivate a discriminating power - learn the art of distinguishing the changeless, infinite Substratum from the changing, finite world.</h1>
