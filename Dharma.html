<h2><p align = "justify">Hindus generally believe that dharma was revealed in the Vedas although a more common word there for 'universal law' or 'righteousness' is rita. <i>Dharma is the power that maintains society, it makes the grass grow, the sun shine, and makes us moral people or rather gives humans the opportunity to act virtuously.</i>
But acting virtuously does not mean precisely the same for everyone; different people have different obligations and duties according to their age, gender, and social position. </p></h2>
